# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

# Casetext Homework Assignment
Your task in this challenge is to build a demo web app that is a functional ATM machine. Please use a stubbed backend as if you were interacting with a server (ie reading from a file or local storage). Feel free to add any bells and whistles youâ€™d like.

## Guidelines:
- Please work in React, using Javascript or Typescript, and utilize any additional frameworks or libraries as needed.
- Incorporate state management effectively in your application.
- Utilize React hooks for managing state and side effects.
- Match the provided mocks as closely as possible.
- Please use provided assets.
- A user should be able to check their balance, withdraw funds, and deposit funds after entering their PIN at a minimum.
- Funds should be correctly reflected after a deposit or withdrawal.
- A user's card type should be highlighted once they have entered their correct PIN.
- Please put your code up on your GitHub account.
- Please include instructions about how we can run your app. (If your solution works better in one browser over the others, let us know which one.)

## Optional:
- While a backend is not required for this assignment, if you feel like it will help you, please create one. You may consider setting up a NodeJS backend server with Express to handle all transactions on the server.
